This interactive webpage was created to raise awareness about air quality through compelling data visualisation and design. The goal is to present complex air quality information in a way that is visually engaging, easy to understand, and impactful. The webpage uses real-time air quality data. By using your current location, it gathers information specific to your area. Through carefully crafted visual elements, the webpage brings to life the invisible presence of pollutants in the air. By visualising these particles, it highlights the hidden impact of air pollution on our health and the environment. This design-led approach aims to make people more aware of the often overlooked dangers in the atmosphere and to encourage a more conscious relationship with the air we breathe.
